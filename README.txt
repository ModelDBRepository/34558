README_Komendantov.txt (or Readme.txt in ModelDB)

This simulation reproduces the model published
in:

Komendantov, A.O. and Kononenko, N.I.  (2000)
Caffeine-induced oscillations of the membrane 
potential in Aplysia neurons.  Neurophysiology 32:
77-84.  

The results of a simulation are illustrated in 
L7_01_smu.jpg.

Example use:

Start SNNAP (double click on the SNNAP.jar file)
click on "Run Simulation"
Then in the new window "File"->"Load Simulation"
browse to and load L7_01.smu file to load a simulation
that creates a figure similar to the L7 neuron in Fig 8 
from the paper and click "Start"
